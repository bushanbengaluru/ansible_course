Ansible roles is for reusable tasks
playbook > host > which inventory > task > module > state

Ansible will have
 > task
 > module
 > state

 example: nginx role
    task
    module
    state

Instead or writing everything in playbook, just call role

mkdir aroles
cd aroles
ansible-galaxy init nginxrole

tree .
nginxrole

  connection: localhost
  task:
    - name: Create a resource group

There are a lot of playbooks available for cloud deployments
